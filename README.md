Sandbox
=======

Where I can test out new stuff!

## Stuff in this sandbox:
1. GruntJS
	* Grunt Tasks
		1. Connect (localhost web server with Live Reload)
		2. Watch (minifies and concatenates JS, live reloads on js/css changes)
		3. Compass (compiles scss > css)
		4. JSHint (still need to test)

### Todo:
1. Add Angular Framework - setup JS concatenation/minification
	* Maybe use yoeman generator to scaffold baseline Angular project and add components like controllers
2. Add CSS Framework like Foundation or a less-heavy one just for essentials
