Sandbox
=======

Where I can test out new stuff!

For first time installation, clone this repo and run "npm install" on the directory to get all the dependencies.

## Toys:
1. GruntJS
	* Grunt Tasks
		1. Connect (localhost web server with Live Reload)
		2. Watch (minifies JS, live reloads on js/css/html changes)
		3. Compass (compiles scss > css)
			* ** Depends on having Ruby installed and Compass gem
		4. JSHint (still need to test)
2. Zurb Foundation (SCSS only)

### Todo:
1. Add Angular Framework - setup JS concatenation/minification
	* Maybe use yeoman generator to scaffold baseline Angular project and add components like controllers
2. Add Grunt concatenate package/task (after minification)
3. Test JSHint grunt task
